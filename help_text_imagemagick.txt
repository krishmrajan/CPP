Build ImageMagick-6.7.4-2 on AIX 7.1

Things necessary
  As much as possible install the following library below
    PNG library / ZLIB library http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngcode.html
      ? There is nothing special to mention
    JPEG / JFIF library http://www.ijg.org/
      ? Uninstall the previous version of the library before making it
    JBIG Library http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/jbigkit/
      * Since there is no make install, you can write libraries and include files yourself
        Copy and install
    TIFF library ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/pub/libtiff
      * Depends on ZLIB, JBIG
      ? Uninstall the previous version of the library before making it
      * Basically use xlc for compilation
      ?configuration
        CC = xlc CXX = xlC CFLAGS = "- Duint64 = uint64_t - I / home / ocg / pub / include" LDFLAGS = - L / home / ocg / pub / lib CPPFLAGS = - I / home / ocg / pub / include. configure - prefix = / home / ocg / pub --build = rs6000 - ibm - aix
    bzip2 library http://www.bzip.org/downloads.html
      ? There is nothing special to mention
  Ghostscript
  GNU make

Source
  Fix magick / locale.c as follows
    AIX does not have a strtod_l function but some parts that are hidden by MAGICKCORE_HAVE_STRTOD_L
    It does not seem to be related to strtod_l

configuration
  Execute configure command
    When using the IBM XL compiler CC = xlc CXX = xlC ...
    When using TrueType font --with-windows-font-dir = ...

    CC = xlc CXX = xlC \
    CFLAGS = "- g - O3 - I / home / ocg / pub / include" \
    CXXFLAGS = "- g - O 3 - I / home / ocg / pub / include" \
    CPPFLAGS = "- I / home / ocg / pub / include" \
    LDFLAGS = "- g - O 3 - bsvr 4 - L / home / ocg / pub / lib - R / home / ocg / pub / lib" \
      ./configure \
        - prefix = / home / ocg / pub \
        - with - jpeg = no \
        --with-windows-font-dir = / home / ocg / pub / share / fonts / truetype

  * Inevitably try to link using the jpeg library of / usr / local / lib.
    In my environment it does not exist in / usr / local / lib (you do not have permission to put it)
    I gave up --with-jpeg = no, because JPEG can still be handled, it is no problem.
  * Change / home / ocg / pub to / usr / local and change according to your own environment

Build

    gmake
    gmake check

  * I got an error in convert test

Installation

    gmake install

Remarks
  Work such as using a lot of memory may cause core dump.
  For example, if you tried to make gif animation of sea level altitude deviation from 549 Postscript files, it could not be done (no problem in Linux Ubuntu).
  In that case, you should set the environment variable LDR_CNTRL to MAXDATA = 0x80000000 and execute it.
  However, after execution, unset LDR_CNTRL.
